__02/11/202 summary by sol__

If fO is in a burning house and is trying to lead us out, we are also in a burning house but we don't know yet.
He mentioned earlier on that if we are already happy, then he has nothing to offer us. But he has gathered us all from WSB, which mostly likely means we are missing something in our lives which we seek money to remedy. But money will never remedy it, like how he describes he should be in all accounts a success story

People are being disconnected from one-another in modern society is important.
The evolution of humans from ancient times to modern times involves the transition from a state of mind where one was driven by schizo-like visions to one of planning and temporal-locality where time is marked by artefacts in our memory.
Something about this system is unable to be replicated / something about our current society leads us to obsession with AI, but fO believes we will never reach that goal
The emptiness created listening to the gong is important
Lots of allegories about how we feel, and why so many people feel the need go end it.

Phase 3 has begun.
Look at the alphabet used by the cipher

Book about a boat builder who smacks his head... “examines the landscape of distraction and superficiality plaguing the wired modern mind.”

This one is two fold. How and why is facepalm. And what does the message say. What does it really say. 
Just sit with it. The words “a cat” are not a cat. The concept of a cat is not a cat. The thought of a cat is not a cat. Nothing of what you think, is what you think of. 
You cannot think literally, because you cannot fit a cat in your head.

I have a different perception because I was culture. And now I am not. I am outside of it.
I was in your favorite movies, tv shows, advertisements, websites, internet protocols, news organizations. Not as a concept. As a person. Just like you.

You can be too. :)
I literally was culture.
And now, I have chosen not to be.
Culture makes you doubt, culture makes you insecure, culture tells you you are not enough, and finally, finally, culture tells you to ignore yourself - until you are so bombarded that life becomes hell. It doesn't have to be that way, you just have to listen inside of yourself.
I'm here to hold up a light. And then to go away.
Otherwise it would be a cult.
And we are not a cult.
You can't know what you want, until you stop wanting what they want you to want.
They, we. The same.
We are trapped in a society that forces us to want.
So I chose to give you money, to show you that money won't do it either.
I chose to give the clues to millions of dollars. And not take any of it.
Until you commute in it for 6 months.
Once you have enlightenment, rent will be trivial.
Just like winning in the stock market.
The corporation is the end of fight club. You're living in fight club.
Communism is another 20th century OS.
Happiness is reflexive, it points to the future, it is anticipatory.
Suffering is pain magnified by resistance.

Referring to Corning producing vials for the coronavirus vaccine.
The Stevanato Group, a 71-year-old family-owned firm, provided more than 2 billion of those (The company is also the world’s largest manufacturer of cartridges for insulin pens). A Covid-19 vaccine, which likely will have to be administered in two separate injections, will require billions of additional vials. Stevanato expects the pandemic to drive up demand for its glass vials by 20% over the next two years.

Rhinocerous Play (comes into play later)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros_(play)
Over the course of three acts, the inhabitants of a small, provincial French town turn into rhinoceroses; ultimately the only human who does not succumb to this mass metamorphosis is the central character, Bérenger, a flustered everyman figure who is initially criticized in the play for his drinking, tardiness, and slovenly lifestyle and then, later, for his increasing paranoia and obsession with the rhinoceroses. The play is often read as a response and criticism to the sudden upsurge of Fascism and Nazism during the events preceding World War II, and explores the themes of conformity, culture, fascism, responsibility, logic, mass movements, mob mentality, philosophy and morality.

The Most important part.

The Users involved so far

Final_october

Namsilat

November_dawn

Squabblequack

Godsbutforthewisdom
    
eternal_september


There is fairly obvious evidence that at least final_october and u/namislat are the same person--or pretending to be the same person. Looking briefly through u/namsilat’s post history, we don't have to dig far to find this post:


![971754529a6c08702e42b4efbd5cadde.png](images\971754529a6c08702e42b4efbd5cadde.png)


“And at my personal sub r/thecorportation” Which pretty much states it outright. However, for brevity take these as well:


![af2d5403957e141505c35e17233e21a2.png](images\af2d5403957e141505c35e17233e21a2.png)


“I wrote this down in my sub…”

As compared to this post in r/thecorporation (the same):


![2781e59cc2c1bdbfe83a20faede7417b.png](images\2781e59cc2c1bdbfe83a20faede7417b.png)


And of course, while seemingly a little obvious, these posts, combined with u/namsilat’s profile picture being the same as final_october’s picture on the discord channel:


![295dd6d876ec5cce1cf9d1f72f9df70e.png](images\295dd6d876ec5cce1cf9d1f72f9df70e.png) ![66a748bbc6bd81306567db3aee0c56e5.png](images\66a748bbc6bd81306567db3aee0c56e5.png)



What’s interesting, is the posts that u/namsilat makes directed at u/final_october, and as far as I can find, never directly admits it.


![eab76b1f0f4b5cbdd2c1f9d8140d18be.png](images\eab76b1f0f4b5cbdd2c1f9d8140d18be.png)


As well as the posts in r/thecorporationwiki:

https://www.reddit.com/r/thecorporationwiki/

And an example here, in a slightly meta thread after the incredible timing of the GME post:


![36cb2081a7ba6ed85b4fe2237a0304e1.png](images\36cb2081a7ba6ed85b4fe2237a0304e1.png)


“Are you u/namsilat? [...] The answer to all of those is… I don’t know”

“Hey so this isn't you? [...] Yes”
As well as all the posts in r/thecorporationwiki:

The Most important Part?  

This leads us to the most important part (in my opinion):


![6ea44c8cda5f4bb104e6768b09a4dc0c.png](images\6ea44c8cda5f4bb104e6768b09a4dc0c.png)


“I’m just a dude. Please forgive all the theatrics. I wanted you guys to have some fun while you made money”

It’s possible the multiple users is a relation to the name r/thecorporation, which implies a collective entity, and wouldn't surprise that keeping separate users adds to the environment of what is happening here.

My guess is ‘the theatrics’ is to keep everything from being linear-- assuming final_october and namsilat are the same person, it would not be too difficult to assume that other users are also the person behind final_october. Having multiple users, regardless of how many real people are behind them provides a number of different avenues for clues to put together, requiring more effort. In other words -- It’s fun.

The people behind the screen

It’s very important to take note of this:

Following a pretty standard google query leads us to a Youtube Channel that final_october stated has nothing to do with this.

This is a boundary--


 ![e71d7a1ab1f1318b83665721aae809c2.png](images\e71d7a1ab1f1318b83665721aae809c2.png)


After decoding the first post -- we know that a code was to be sent to a domain nextse7en.com and that the site itself, while not live anymore, provided some clues that are available on the wayback machine.

How does this relate?

He owns a web domain. He used it for this. As this statement provides:

“My Story is the story” Implies that some digging is required. But take great care. There is a line, there is always a line.

He asked us not to DOX him. DO NOT DOX HIM.

Boy, milk and mild Made still and wide eyed By sharp hearts before him Became chasm, canyon wide and wailing yelling and wind and flashing eyes With no warm walls for the breaking And so bore it, until dark days made vision dim and wind chorused in ears to echo there Long after both had broken with cold and fear for shelter Found then by broad smiles And warm earth calloused hands, Among green leaves cloistered unashamed of their need for the sun He saw no strength here from the storm No sinews stretched and hardened No hearts made rock to withstand their own beating And learned That strength is in the leaning and love is in its giving That food is in the feeding That the wind is not everywhere It only rings now in her ears when riotous love Has drifted off in her warmth.
