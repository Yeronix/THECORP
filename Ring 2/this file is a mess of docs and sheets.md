THE PHRASE  
“I CAN HEAR THE BELLS OUT MY WINDOW”  
"THE SOUND OF A BELL"  
IS NOT THE SAME.  
AS THE SOUND OF A BELL.  
ALL WE BELIVE IS SIMPLY A SIGNPOST, TO ALL THAT IS.  
AND THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME.  
THE CORPORATION COOPERATES.

Feel free to add anything in these lines:
asking @Godsbutforthewisdom the right questions about what fO is
eternal september (think usenet) -> final october (fO IS the end of that cycle, a return to balance)

__02/11/202 summary by sol__

If fO is in a burning house and is trying to lead us out, we are also in a burning house but we don't know yet.
He mentioned earlier on that if we are already happy, then he has nothing to offer us. But he has gathered us all from WSB, which mostly likely means we are missing something in our lives which we seek money to remedy. But money will never remedy it, like how he describes he should be in all accounts a success story

People are being disconnected from one-another in modern society is important.
The evolution of humans from ancient times to modern times involves the transition from a state of mind where one was driven by schizo-like visions to one of planning and temporal-locality where time is marked by artefacts in our memory.
Something about this system is unable to be replicated / something about our current society leads us to obsession with AI, but fO believes we will never reach that goal
The emptiness created listening to the gong is important
Lots of allegories about how we feel, and why so many people feel the need go end it.
