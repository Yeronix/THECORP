# THE CORPORATION
#### So shines a good deed in a weary world.

Take a moment, stay a while.

#### How do you organise something like this? 

Trick question, you don't. It's something you feel out, you learn as you go, you don't spread it all out for the sun. So of course, I'm trying to do just that I mentioned you don't do; if you are reading this, I am hoping you will be able to help.

We have three rings. No content should be added to the root folder, where this readme and the scratchpad reside. 

Raw material goes into the unrefined [Ring 2]; once it is deemed acceptable, it can be moved to [Ring 1], our further refinement location. 

Material in [Ring 2] will need to be sorted, filtered, and distilled, before we can use it for our narrative efforts.

Material in [Ring 1] is being refined and staged for use in [Ring 0]. Ring 1 is where most of the 'writing' will happen, as [Ring 0] is where content will be available to read once it is complete; very little work should be happening in Ring 0.

I apologise if this is a bit clunky, I am open to other ways we might more efficiently structure this enigma.
